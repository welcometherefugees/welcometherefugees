<h3>Why is it so empty here?</h3>
<p>
You're wondering why there's nothing here? We came up with the idea today
(24. January 2016) and we're only working on realising the concept since that day.
</p>
<h3>What concept?</h3>
<p>
<b>Refugees Welcome</b>, but nobody welcomes then. New idea: <b>Welcome The Refugees</b>.
We want to make this site into an informational portal, full of information,
messages for those, who just arrived here and education for those, who
wanting to know more about the so-called "refugee crisis." We also hope
to be able to create a blog with news.
</p>
<h3>When will that happen?</h3>
<p>
Very soon. If you already know how you could help, <a href="mailto:lw.leonweber@gmail.com">send an e-mail</a>.
